# Text_Transformations

### NOTE: 
####    1. This repo contains all the extra credit assignmnets
####    2. I did all this work on my own by re-running each code line

#### **** Implemented in keras, GPT2, BERT *****

####  

#### OBSERVATIONS :

### 1. Pre-requisites for running this notebooks: I Ran text extraction with bert in TPU mode of colab and rest of all the notebooks in GPU mode
### 2. To run semantic similarity using BERT, GPT and GLOve you need to install allennlp==0.4.2 version 

I tried to fix the error in existing versioning code using this [solution link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62884591/modulenotfounderror-no-module-named-allennlp-commands-elmo)
